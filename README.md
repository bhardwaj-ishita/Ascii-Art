# Ascii-Art

This project is inspired from Robert Heaton's list of projects. 
And this src code is my version.
A few steps were taken into account while building it. 

0. Choose an image
1. Read your image and print its height and width in pixels
2. Load your imageâ€™s pixel data into a 2-dimensional array
3. Convert the RGB tuples of your pixels into single brightness numbers
4. Convert brightness numbers to ASCII characters
5. Print your ASCII art!

As the image processing library I tries using ImageJ.
